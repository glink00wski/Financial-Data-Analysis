# Data Analysis: Revenue and Profit Trends by Region

## Overview
This project analyzes a financial dataset spanning three years (2020-2022), focusing on revenue, profit, and profit margins across different regions and products. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights.

## Key Findings
1. **Revenue Trends Over Time**:
   - Total revenue exhibits seasonal fluctuations.
   - Consistent growth is observed in certain periods, but no significant spikes are apparent.

2. **Regional Comparison**:
   - Total revenue and profit are distributed relatively evenly across regions.
   - Statistical tests (ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis) confirmed no significant differences in revenue between regions.

3. **Profit Margins**:
   - Average profit margins show slight seasonal variations but remain relatively stable.

4. **Product Insights**:
   - Revenue distribution varies significantly between products, highlighting differences in performance.

## Statistical Analysis
### Tests Performed:
- **ANOVA**: No significant difference in mean revenue across regions (\(p = 0.63\)).
- **Kruskal-Wallis**: Supported ANOVA results, indicating no significant differences in median revenue across regions (\(p = 0.62\)).

### Assumptions:
- Data normality was not satisfied (tested using Shapiro-Wilk, \(p < 0.05\)).
- Variances were homogeneous (tested using Leveneâ€™s test, \(p = 0.98\)).

## Next Steps
- Extend the dataset to include more granular details, such as customer demographics or marketing campaigns.
- Investigate product-specific performance trends further to identify growth opportunities.
